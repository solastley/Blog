			As a computer scientist and full-stack developer, I consider
			 myself incredibly fortunate to have worked personally with some
			 of the most talented designers that I know. Working with the engineering
			 team at MAYA Design has taught me so much about the importance of
			 human-centered design in development, and I continue to apply this
			 knowledge in all of my work.

			I will primarily be using this blog to post about some of my web dev 
			adventures and to make some (hopefully) useful tutorials. I don't expect 
			that it will get much traffic, but if I can help or impress even one 
			viewer then I would be happy. Please feel free to comment on anything you 
			read, it would probably make my day.

			This fall I will be a full-time computer science student at The University 
			of Pittsburgh, but I will be actively seeking employment opportunities for 
			the summer of 2017. To read about or view some of my work, please visit
