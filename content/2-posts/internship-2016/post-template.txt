##Introduction
During the summer of 2016, I worked full-time as a software engineering intern at a company called MAYA Design, located in downtown Pittsburgh, PA. I would call this  not only my first internship, but also my first real job as a developer. Writing this now, I still have trouble believing it. Earlier this spring, by some miracle, I managed to convince these guys that I actually knew what I was doing and land a job. Here's the harsh truth – my only experience as a programmer was my Java data structures class, and the only "development" I had ever done was modify some Twitter Bootstrap templates for static one-page websites. I had a large gap to bridge before I would ever consider calling myself a real full-stack developer.

I am writing this blog post, now, at the end of summer 2016 – my last week at MAYA. Now, finally, I believe I've earned the title. Let me tell you about what I made.

##The Emergency Law Inventory
Lucky for me, the first project that I was placed on was one that was still in very early stages of development, so I didn't need to spend a ton of time diving into the code base. In fact, the website was pretty much non-existent when I was placed on the team. In order to understand the scope of the project, some background info is probably called for.

###The Premise
First, imagine you're a medical reserve corps (MRC) emergency respondent that lives in Pennsylvania. You work as an EMT, so you're frequently involved in life-threatening situations. Unfortunately, these types of situations don't always end well. Fortunately for you, as a certified EMT in Pennsylvania, you know that you're protected by scope of practice and liability state laws. Now, on the other hand, imagine that a massive natural disaster occurs in West Virginia, not far from where you live in Pennsylvania. The MRC calls on you to respond and lend your skills and time to help those in need. Normally you would be more than happy to help, but there's one thing you can't help but wonder about – "Do the West Virginia liability laws apply to me the same way as they do in Pennsylvania?"

Well, as it turns out, they don't. Liability and scope of practice laws vary greatly from state to state, and it's not common for MRC emergency respondents to not know whether or not they're liable for certain actions they take while deployed to a state outside of their own. This is a problem. A big problem, actually, because it gets the best kinds of people in the worst kind of trouble. Emergency respondents end up being sued for reckless endangerment and other related issues, even though they were just trying to help. If only there were some way they could know beforehand whether or not they were liable for their actions. Well, thanks to the MRC, the University of Pittsburgh Law School, and MAYA Design, now there is.
