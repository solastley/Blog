##Overview
You may have seen this project floating around the Internet before, and maybe even some guides for how to make one. A Magic Mirror is basically an LED monitor behind a two-way mirror that displays some text or images. It sounds pretty trivial, but the end result is actually really cool. Check it out:

As long as it's connected to the Internet, you can display just about anything on the mirror that you want (within reason). With a little Internet-of-Things magic, you can even incorporate sensors and buttons for interactive abilities. This blog post will largely be a revision of (link: http://blog.dylanjpierce.com/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html text: this) tutorial on how to create a magic mirror. I used Pierce's guide while creating my mirror, but I noticed that some of his code is outdated and it's much easier to use the MagicMirror open source software for this project.

##The Raspberry Pi
In order to run the MagicMirror software, you'll need a Raspberry Pi. I recommend using the Raspberry Pi 3. I ordered (link: https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Clear-Power-Supply/dp/B01C6EQNNK/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1488478584&sr=1-3&keywords=raspberry+pi text: this) product from Amazon, which comes with a convenient case for the Pi, a power cable,  and two heat sinks. Additionally, you'll need a (link: https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Preloaded-NOOBS-Card/dp/B00ENPQ1GK/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1488478701&sr=1-6&keywords=raspberry+pi+sd+card text: micro-SD card pre-loaded with NOOBS), an automated operating system installer which installs Raspbian, the most popular operating system for the Raspberry Pi.
